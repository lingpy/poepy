  Just gonna stand there and watch me [h]burn
  But that's alright, because I like the way it [h]hurts
  Just gonna stand there and hear me [i]cry
  But that's alright, because I love the way you [i]lie
  I love the way you [i]lie
  I love the way you [i]lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels [a/:laik]like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my wind[a/paip]pipe
I can't breathe, but I still [a/:fait]fight, while I can [a/:fait]fight
As long as the wrong feels [a/:rait]right, it's like I'm in [a/:flait]flight
High off of love drunk from my [f/:hEit]hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I [b/:lVvIt]love_it the more that I [b/:sVf@]suffer
I [b/:sVfOkEit]suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She [c/:rIsVsItEitsmi:]resuscitates_me, she fucking [c/:hEitsmi:]hates_me,
And I love it, [f/:wEit]wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, [d/:kVmbEk]come_back
We're running [d/:raitbEk]right_back, here we go [e/:VgEin]again
It's so [e/:InsEin]insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going [e/:grEit]great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois [e/:lEin]Lane
But when it's bad, it's [g/:Ofu:l]awful
I feel so [e]ashamed, I snapped, who's that [g/:TEtdu:d]dude
I don't even know his [e/:nEim]name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low [e/:VgEin]again, I guess I don't know my own [e/:strEÅ‹T]strength

  Just gonna stand there and watch me [h]burn
  But that's alright, because I like the way it [h]hurts
  Just gonna stand there and hear me [i]cry
  But that's alright, because I love the way you [i]lie
  I love the way you [i]lie
  I love the way you [i]lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely [j]breathe, when you're [k]with_them, you [j]meet
And neither one of you, even know what [k]hit_'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to [k]get_'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking [k]at_'em
You swore you've never [k]hit_'em, never do nothing to [k]hurt_'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing [k]venom, and these words, when you [k]spit_'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, [k]bit_'em,
Throw 'em down, [l]pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're [l]in_'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause [m]today, that was [m]yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a [m]different_day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show [e]restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo [e]game, but you lied [e]again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window [e]pane

  Just gonna stand there and watch me [h]burn
  But that's alright, because I like the way it [h]hurts
  Just gonna stand there and hear me [i]cry
  But that's alright, because I love the way you [i]lie
  I love the way you [i]lie
  I love the way you [i]lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't [o]mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same [o]routine, but your temper's just as bad, as [p]mine_is
You're the same as [o]me, but when it comes to love, you're just as [p]blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was [o]me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it [o]seems
Maybe that's what happens When a [q]tornado meets a [q]volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the [r]sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when [r]I_talk,
Told you this is [r]my_fault, look me in the [r]eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the [r]dry_wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I [s]apologize even though I know it's [s]lies
I'm tired of the [e]games, I just want her back, I know I'm a [t]liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave [e]again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on [t]fire

  Just gonna stand there and watch me [h]burn
  But that's alright, because I like the way it [h]hurts
  Just gonna stand there and hear me [i]cry
  But that's alright, because I love the way you [i]lie
  I love the way you [i]lie
  I love the way you [i]lie
