The guilty undertaker [a/s_ai_s]sighs
The lonesome organ grinder [a/k_r_ai_s]cries
The silver saxophones [a/s_æi]say 
I should [b/r_i_f_j_uː_s_j_uː]refuse_you
The cracked bells and washed-out [c/h_ɔ_r_n_s]horns
Blow into my face with [c/s_k_ɔ_r_n]scorn, 
but it’s not that way, I wasn’t [c/b_ɔ_r_n]born 
to [b/l_uː_s_j_uː]lose you

  I want you
  I want you
  I want you, so bad
  Honey, I want you

The drunken politician [e/l_iː_p_s]leaps
Upon the street where mothers [e/w_iː_p]weep
And the saviors who are fast [e/a_s_l_iː_p]asleep, 
they [f/w_æi_t_f_ɔ_r_j_uː]wait_for_you
And I wait for them to [g/ɪ_n_t_ə_r_ʌ_p_t]interrupt
Me drinkin’ from my [g/b_r_ɔ_k_e_n_k_ʌ_p]broken_cup
And ask me to [g/ɔ_p_ə_n_ʌ_p]open up the 
[f/g_æ_i_t_f_ɔ_r_j_uː]gate for you

  I want you
  I want you
  Yes I want you, so bad
  Honey, I want you

How all my fathers, they’ve gone [i/d_au_n]down
True love they’ve been [j/w_i_θ_au_t_ɪ_t]without_it
But all their daughters put [i/d_au_n]me down
’Cause I don’t think [j/a_b_au_t_ɪ_t]about_it
Well, I return to the Queen of [k/s_p_æi_d_z]Spades
And talk with my [k/tʃ_ɛ_m_b_ə_r_m_æi_d]chambermaid
She knows that I’m not afraid to look [m/æ_t_h_ø_r]at her
She is good to [l/m_iː]me 
and there’s Nothing she doesn’t [l/s_iː]see
She knows where I’d like to [l/s_iː]be 
but it doesn’t [m/m_æ_t_ə_r]Matter

  I want you
  I want you
  Yes I want you, so bad
  Honey, I want you

Now your dancing child with his Chinese [n/s_uː_t]suit he
Spoke to me, I took his [n/f_l_uː_t]flute
No, I wasn’t very [n/k_j_uː_t]cute 
to him, [p/w_ɔ_z_ai]was_I?
But I did it, because he [o/l_ai_d]lied and
Because he took you for a [o/r_ai_d]ride
And because time was on his [o/s_ai_d]side 
and [p/b_i_k_ɔ_z_ai]Because_I

  Want you
  I want you
  Yes I want you, so bad
  Honey, I want you
